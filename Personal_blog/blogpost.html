            <h2>Day one: Amazing experience in Antartica</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-date">February 1, 2020 by <a href="#">Soumya</a></p>
            <p>No place on Earth compares to this vast white wilderness of elemental forces: snow, ice, water, rock. Antarctica is simply stunning.  
                Any time spent in Antarctica, one of the planet’s most extreme and inhospitable places, inevitably involves an adventure. </p> 
 
            <h3>Meeting the penguins</h3>
            <p>When you first lay eyes on these ever-anthropomorphized birds, you’ll know you’ve arrived in the Antarctic. 
                From the tiny tuxedo-clad Adélie and the bushy-browed macaroni, to the world’s largest penguin, the fabulously debonair emperor, 
                the Antarctic offers a chance to see these unique creatures on their own turf: sea, ice and shore.</p>
                <p>Spotted them:</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>shooting out of the water</li> 
                    <li>tobogganing along the ice</li>
                    <li>squawking</li>
                    <li>caring for their young</li>
                </ul> 
            <h3>Lemaire channel</h3>
            <p>This steep-sided channel <u>just 1600m (5250ft) wide – runs for 11km (7 miles) -</u> between the mountains of Booth Island and the Peninsula. 
                So photogenic that it's been dubbed 'Kodak Gap,' the passageway is only visible once you're nearly inside it. 
                The channel was first navigated by the Belgian de Gerlache in 1898 and named after a Belgian explorer of the Congo.
                Unfortunately, ice sometimes blocks the way, so ships may be forced to retreat and sail outside Booth Island. 
                At the northern end of the Lemaire are two tall, rounded and often snowcapped peaks at Cape Renard.</p>

            <h2>Day two: South Station</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-date">February 1, 2020 by <a href="#">Soumya</a></p>
            <p>First reached just <em>over 100 years ago</em> by the valiant explorer <em>Roald Amundsen</em> during the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration, 
                the South Pole still embodies myth, hardship and glory. Today it is topped by a high-tech station surrounded by cutting-edge astrophysical observation equipment 
                (including a neutrino detector array buried approximately 1.9 km below the ice). To the visitor, a photo op with the flapping flags and globe-topped pole, is, indeed, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
                The South Pole station was built in phases, so the first group of occupants was able to take up residence in January 2003, and it was officially inaugurated in January 2008. 
                Full summer operations began in October 2011. The 6039-sq-meter, elevated station stretches 128m, facing the prevailing winds with an aeronautical design that helps scour snow from beneath it. 
                The complex accommodates 150 people in summer and 50 in winter.</p>
            <h3> Camp Evans</h3>
            <p>Reaching Ross Island’s Cape Evans isn’t easy – but then again, it never was. 
                Dog skeletons bleach on the sand in the Antarctic sun, chiding memento mori of Captain Robert Scott’s death march from the Pole. Inside Scott’s hut from that ill-fated Terra Nova expedition a collection of sledging pennants, 
                rustling pony harnesses and a sighing wind evoke the doomed men who left here with high hopes of reaching the pole. Explore the captain’s bunk room, and peer at the perfectly preserved provisions and photographic supplies.</p>

            <h2>Namib desert</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-date">January 20, 2020 by <a href="#">Soumya</a></p>
            <p>It doesn't get much more dramatic than the gigantic dunes of <b>Sossusvlei</b>, in the heart of the Namib Desert, and one of the most iconic sights in Africa.</p> 
         
            <p>Sossusvlei is a clay pan, or dry lake, enclosed by giant sand dunes - thought to be the tallest in the world. Very occasionally, when there has been sufficient rainfall to cause the Tsauchab River to flow, 
                the pan fills with water and becomes a turquoise lake that lasts just a few weeks and makes the scenery even more surreal. 
                The dunes have been sculpted by the wind over millions of years, and some of them have become petrified over time</p>
            <p>The nearby NamibRand Nature Reserve lies on the eastern edge of the Namib Desert and contains a desert tapestry of colours and shapes that make it a visual utopia for those in search of natural beauty on a safari holiday. 
                Game species found in the reserve include oryx, zebra, ostrich, giraffe, several species of antelope, and a wide variety of smaller desert creatures. Over a hundred species of birds have also been recorded.</p>
