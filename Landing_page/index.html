        <h2> Classification techniques</h2>
        <p>Classification techniques predict discrete responses—for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, 
          or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. 
          Typical applications include medical imaging, speech recognition, and credit scoring. 
          Use classification if your data can be tagged, categorized, or separated into specific groups or classes. 
          For example, applications for hand-writing recognition use classification to recognize letters and numbers. 
          In image processing and computer vision, unsupervised pattern recognition techniques are used for object detection 
          and image segmentation.</p>

        <p>Common algorithms for performing classification include support vector machine (SVM), boosted and bagged decision trees, 
          k-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="section2" data-nav="Regression" class="active">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Regression techniques</h2>
        <p>Regression techniques predict continuous responses—for example, changes in temperature or fluctuations in power demand. 
          Typical applications include electricity load forecasting and algorithmic trading. \
          Use regression techniques if you are working with a data range or if the nature of your response is a real number, 
          such as temperature or the time until failure for a piece of equipment.</p>
        
        <p>Common regression algorithms include linear model, nonlinear model, regularization, stepwise regression, boosted and 
          bagged decision trees, neural networks, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy learning.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Clustering" class="active">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Clustering</h2>
        <p>Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning technique. It is used for exploratory data analysis 
          to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. Applications for cluster analysis include gene sequence analysis, 
          market research, and object recognition. For example, if a cell phone company wants optimize the locations 
          where they build cell phone towers, they can use machine learning to estimate the number of clusters of people r
          elying on their towers. A phone can only talk to one tower at a time, so the team uses clustering algorithms 
          to design the best placement of cell towers to optimize signal reception for groups, or clusters, of their customers.</p>

        <p> Common algorithms for performing clustering include k-means and k-medoids, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models, self-organizing maps, fuzzy c-means clustering, and subtractive clustering.</p>

      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Guidelines to choose</h2>
        <p>Here are some guidelines on choosing between supervised and unsupervised machine learning:</p>

        <p>Choose supervised learning if you need to train a model to make a prediction--for example, the future value of a continuous variable, such as temperature or a stock price, or a classification—for example, identify makes of cars from webcam video footage.</p>
        <p>Choose unsupervised learning if you need to explore your data and want to train a model to find a good internal representation, such as splitting data up into clusters.</p>
